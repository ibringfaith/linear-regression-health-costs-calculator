# Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator
#### freeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python Project 4

In this challenge, I predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm.

To pass the challenge, `model.evaluate` must return a Mean Absolute Error of under 3500. This means it predicts health care costs correctly within $3500.

The final cell will also predict expenses using the test_dataset and graph the results.
